#### Terms

  - **Agent** = Decision maker or controller.
  - **Action**  **a** = **Decision** or **control**. **u**
  - **Environment** = System.
  - **Reward** of a stage  **r**  = (Opposite of) **Cost** of a stage.  **g**
  - **State**  **s** = **x**
  - **time**  **t** = **i**
  - **discount factor** $\gamma$ = $\alpha$
  - State value  = (Opposite of) Cost starting from a state.
  - **Value** (or reward, or state-value) function = (Opposite of) **Cost** function.
  - Maximizing the value function = Minimizing the cost function.
  - **Action** (or state-action) value = Q-factor (or Q-value) of a state- control pair.
  - **Planning** = Solving a DP problem with a known mathematical model.
  - **Learning** = Solving a DP problem in model-free fashion.
  - Self-learning (or **self-play** in the context of games) = Solving a DP problem using policy iteration.
  - **Deep reinforcement learning** = Approximate DP using value and/or policy approximation with deep neural networks.
  - **Prediction** = Policy evaluation.
  - **Generalized policy iteration** = Optimistic policy iteration.
  - State abstraction = Aggregation.
  - Learning a model = System identification.
  - **Episodic** task or **episode** = Finite-step system trajectory.
  - **Continuing** task = Infinite-step system trajectory.
  - **Backup** = Applying the DP operator at some state.
  - **Sweep** = Applying the DP operator at all states.
  - **Greedy** policy with respect to a cost function J = Minimizing policy in the DP expression defined by J.
  - **Afterstate** = Post-decision state.



#### Notation of  optimal control

  - $x$: **state**.
  - $u$: **control**.
  - $J$: **cost function**.
  - $g$: **cost** per stage.
  - $f$: **system function**.
  - $i$: **discrete state**.
  - $p_{ij} (u)$: **transition probability** from state i to state j under control u.
